# Analysis of Weather and Data Patterns
A two part analysis of weather data on worldwide cities. Part I will use a simple Python library, the OpenWeather Man API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities. Scatter plots and linear regression will be used to visualize respective city data. Part II will utilize jupyter-gmaps and Google Places to uncover weather data for specific vacation spots. Heat maps of each world's city humidity will be overlapped with the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of each coordinate.
